                <p>Food For Free improves access to healthy food through establishing innovative programming and
                    partnerships to overcome barriers and strengthen the community food system. We envision a future
                    where everyone in our community – regardless of age, income, or ability – has consistent access to
                    fresh, healthy, delicious food.

                <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                <p>Rotational shelter is Family Promise’s original shelter model. The rotational shelter model engages a
                    network of community partners, often faith communities, to house families with children in different
                    locations on a rotational basis. This innovative model— mobilizing volunteers to help house families
                    in community space—has helped over one million children and adults.
